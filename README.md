# Game Of Live
This program is about Game of live (a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970).
It has been done in order to learn Python and PyGame library, so it could have some beginner mistakes (I hope not).
Also, it has been created using this tutorial: https://youtu.be/qPtKv9fSHZY (from DotCSV).
